## A blob eat blob world


- **What will the application do?**

*The application will be a game. In this game, the user will play as a blob. 
The goal of the game will be to grow as big as possible while avoiding death, which can occur by 
being hit by traps or eaten by other, larger blobs.
The user will be able to move the blob in cardinal directions around the play area. 
There will be other entities in the play area such as food, power-ups, and other blobs. 
The user will interact with these entities by moving their blob into them.
Moving into different entities will either help the user's blob grow, or make the user's blob shrink.*


- **Who will use it?**

*Myself, and others in the class who might be interested in playing the game. Potentially, anonymous users
online.*

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

*I have always been interested in trying to code a game and tackling the challenge of coding something
that runs well and is fun to play. This project seems simple to start, but also has a lot of room to add complexity in
the future. As I learn more in the course, I plan to optimize what is already there and
add additional functionality.*

*Some ideas I have now are:*

- *adding additional enemy blob behaviour, like hunting down the player and other blobs*
- *adding different levels*
- *adding different power-ups*
- *adding a way to save progress and game state using a string*
